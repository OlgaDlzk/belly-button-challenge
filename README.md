# belly-button-challenge

## We built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

  Vizualizations of the project:

    1. Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in each particular individual
    2. Bubble chart that displays each sample
    3. Gauge Chart to display the weekly washing frequency of the individual
    
We also displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.

All plots are updated when a new sample is selected!
